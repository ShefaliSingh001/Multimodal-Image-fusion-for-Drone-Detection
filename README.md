This project performs image fusion of IR and synthesized RGB image for Drone detection. The IR images are synthesized to create corresponding RGB images to perform image fuaion.
The fusion is performed by FPDE, or Fractional Partial Differential Equations, used to enhance the quality and features of combined images. 
The model training is done using YOLO-Nas Small. 
The IR dataset used is taken from Roboflow- Infrared Imaging Based Drone Detection.
